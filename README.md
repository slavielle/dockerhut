# dockerhut

## What is it ?
As a web developper developping website mainly in Drupal, I"m interested in Docker as a web developpement environment (in substitution to VM). 

Dockerhut is an attempt to make an easy to use development environment on top of Docker for people who, like me works on litte or middle size websites development.

Dockerhut is mainly a bunch of bash scripts an a fiew tricks around docker. it use only one container aiming to host runtime environment tools (such as Apache, php, MySQL) and buidling tools (such as gulp, sass, ect) of a project. This way you can easily achive and restore or share your docker image with colleague working on the same projet

## Bare with me disclaimer
I'm not a experimented developper on bash script development. My code could certainly be improved. 

So far I tested it on my Ubuntu Xenial Xerus so bare with me if it chashes on other linux systems.

Whatever, feel free to collaborate and pull request me :)
